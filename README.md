# int _(_(_(\*\*x[])(char_, int*(*)(char*)))[])(char\*\*, char*(\*)());

## The name of the group can be read as "x is an array of pointers to functions that take as parameters a pointer to a character and a pointer to a function that takes a pointer to a character and returns a pointer to an integer. These functions return a pointer to an array of pointers to functions that take as parameters a pointer to a pointer to a character and a pointer to a function that returns a pointer to a character, and return a pointer to an integer"... it is just for fun.
